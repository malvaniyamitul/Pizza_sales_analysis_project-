🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis

SQL & Power BI | Business Intelligence Project

📌 Overview 

This project analyzes a pizza restaurant’s sales data using SQL and Power BI to uncover meaningful business insights.
The objective is to help decision-makers understand revenue trends, product performance, and customer behavior so they can improve profitability, optimize the menu, and plan operations more effectively.

🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering key business questions:

Which pizzas generate the most revenue and highest demand?

What are the best and worst performing products?

When do customers order the most?

Which pizza sizes contribute most to revenue?

How can the business increase sales and efficiency?

🛠 Technology & Analytical Techniques Used

SQL:-

Complex JOINs, subqueries, and window functions

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT) for KPI calculations

Date functions for daily and monthly trend analysis

GROUP BY & HAVING for category and product performance

Power BI:-

Power Query for data cleaning and structuring

Data modeling to build table relationships

DAX measures for revenue, AOV, and sales KPIs

Built interactive Power BI dashboards using slicers, filters, ranking visuals, and trend analysis to support data-driven decisions

 📊  Business Insights
 
The pizza business generated $817.86K from 21K orders, selling over 50K pizzas, with an average of 2.32 pizzas per order — indicating strong multi-item purchasing behavior. 

Friday is the highest-demand day (3.5K orders), followed by Saturday and Thursday, making weekends the most profitable operating period. 

Order volume peaks in March (1,935 orders) and remains high in October, January, and December, reflecting clear seasonal demand patterns. 

Large pizzas contribute nearly 46% of total revenue, making size-upselling one of the strongest revenue growth levers. 

Classic pizzas lead all categories in volume (15K pizzas sold), showing that traditional flavors drive the most consistent customer demand. 

The Thai Chicken Pizza and Barbecue Chicken Pizza are the top-selling products, each generating about $43K, making them the business’s flagship offerings. 

A small group of pizzas contributes a large share of total sales, while low-performing items like The Brie Carre and Spinach-based pizzas generate minimal revenue, indicating opportunities for menu optimization. 

Customer ordering behavior supports combo and family-pack strategies, as customers buy more than two pizzas per order on average. 

 🚧 Challenges Faced
 
Data cleaning and consistency:-

The raw sales data contained multiple pizza categories, sizes, and naming formats, which required careful standardization before analysis.

Complex KPI calculations:-

Metrics like Average Order Value and Average Pizzas per Order required combining multiple tables and applying accurate aggregations using SQL.
Time-based analysis:

Extracting meaningful trends by day of week and month required advanced date handling and grouping logic.

Dashboard design:-

Designing a Power BI report that presents KPIs, trends, and product performance clearly without overwhelming users was a key visualization challenge.
