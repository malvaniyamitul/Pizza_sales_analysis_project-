🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis

SQL & Power BI | Business Intelligence Project

📌 Overview 

• This project analyzes a pizza restaurant’s sales data using SQL and Power BI to uncover meaningful business insights.
• The objective is to help decision-makers understand revenue trends, product performance, and customer behavior so they can improve profitability, optimize the menu, and plan operations more effectively.

🎯 Business Objectives

• The goal of this project is to analyze historical pizza sales data to:

• Understand sales performance over time

• Identify top and under-performing products.

• Reveal customer ordering patterns.

• provide actionable business recommendations for growth and profitability.

🛠 Technology & Analytical Techniques Used

SQL:-

• Complex JOINs, subqueries, and window functions

• Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT) for KPI calculations

• Date functions for daily and monthly trend analysis

• GROUP BY & HAVING for category and product performance

Power BI:-

• Power Query for data cleaning and structuring

• Data modeling to build table relationships

• DAX measures for revenue, AOV, and sales KPIs

• Built interactive Power BI dashboards using slicers, filters, ranking visuals, and trend analysis to support data-driven decisions

 📊  Business Insights
 
• The pizza business generated $817.86K from 21K orders, selling over 50K pizzas, with an average of 2.32 pizzas per order — indicating strong multi-item purchasing behavior. 

• Friday is the highest-demand day (3.5K orders), followed by Saturday and Thursday, making weekends the most profitable operating period. 

• Order volume peaks in March (1,935 orders) and remains high in October, January, and December, reflecting clear seasonal demand patterns. 

• Large pizzas contribute nearly 46% of total revenue, making size-upselling one of the strongest revenue growth levers. 

• Classic pizzas lead all categories in volume (15K pizzas sold), showing that traditional flavors drive the most consistent customer demand. 

• The Thai Chicken Pizza and Barbecue Chicken Pizza are the top-selling products, each generating about $43K, making them the business’s flagship offerings. 

• A small group of pizzas contributes a large share of total sales, while low-performing items like The Brie Carre and Spinach-based pizzas generate minimal revenue, indicating opportunities for menu optimization. 

• Customer ordering behavior supports combo and family-pack strategies, as customers buy more than two pizzas per order on average. 

 🚧 Challenges Faced
 
Data cleaning and consistency:-

• The raw sales data contained multiple pizza categories, sizes, and naming formats, which required careful standardization before analysis.

Complex KPI calculations:-

• Metrics like Average Order Value and Average Pizzas per Order required combining multiple tables and applying accurate aggregations using SQL.

Time-based analysis:

• Extracting meaningful trends by day of week and month required advanced date handling and grouping logic.

Dashboard design:-

• Designing a Power BI report that presents KPIs, trends, and product performance clearly without overwhelming users was a key visualization challenge.

📚 Key Skills & Knowledge Gained

• Writing optimized SQL queries to calculate business KPIs, rankings, and time-based trends from large transactional datasets.

• Using Power BI for business storytelling, not just charts — creating dashboards that highlight what drives revenue and what needs improvement.

• Identifying Pareto patterns (80/20 rule) in product sales to separate high-impact products from low performers.

• Translating data into business decisions, such as menu optimization, upselling strategies, and demand forecasting.

• Building end-to-end analytics projects — from raw data to executive-ready insights.
